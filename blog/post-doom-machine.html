    <h5>Sunn Model-T Preamps</h5>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    
    <p>This build was my first un-officially commissioned build. Mostly because I offered to do it as a birthday present for a close friend. My friend Mark Richards (formerly of Admiral Angry and the Known Strangers) and former roommate / jam buddy is the person who first introduced me into "No [sic] that's not heavy... THIS... listen to <i>THIS<." Everyone needs a friend like that. He showed be Sunn O))) and countless other bands that have become a rabbit hole looking for the most brutal band like it's an arms race hell bent on the destruction of your concepts of reality itself.</p>

    <p>Mark is a huge fan of Sunn amps and I've also always wanted a Model-T, but for bass purposes. One of my favorite bassists -Dan Briggs uses one and I watched him play through one again on BTBAM's Colors live stream performance. And man... I still want one. But they're exceptionally hard to find and expensive. Up until more than a year later, there were no modelers or plug-ins targeting this particular sort of sonic bliss; so I set out to find a circuit that would satisfy these crushingly swol vintage toanz.</p>

    <p>Enter <a href="https://www.coda-effects.com/p/black-hole.html">Coda Effect's Black Hole</a>. Oh yes... suck me right in to the dark heart of the universe! These circuit boards came pre-soldered with genuine Fairchild SMD JFETs and are true to the schematic of the real Sunn Model-T preamp and have a "LPB1 boost " boost function for extra doom. Ah, yes! I was all in to make this, and wanted to make another for a friend who would appreciate this sort of thing. They also came with hand-written note from Benoit himself, which was much appreciated. I highly recommend his products.</p>

    <p>I ordered the parts (as best as I could find) and reached out to my vendor in Simi Valley to see about going for laser etching the enclosures themselves. He was willing to give it a try, and I put up mine as the sacrificial lamb, so that if it didn't work out; I'd find another solution for the commissioned gift pedal.</p>

    <p>Luckily, his CO2 laser was easily up to the task of removing the gloss coating and powder coat right down to the bare aluminum. I was ecstatic that this process worked because; while it doesn't quite have the resolution of silk-screening, it's permanently destructive and it'll stand up to the rigors of the kind of music Mark and I love.</p>

    <p>The artwork inspiration for these came from a shared interest in Nordic culture and perhaps, getting killed playing God of War on PS4, over, and over... again. If you're aiming to fight the gods of the Vikings, you better bring some runes. The tone stack bass, mid, and treble, are depicted as only the first letter, as though they are runic symbols.</p>

    <p>I spent a good amount of time biasing the JFETs with the trimmers and found that... well... I had no idea what I was doing. I don't own a Oscilloscope (yet). However, this was a great learning experience because I had TWO of them, so I could try different things and compare the two side by side. I learned a couple things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No two analog pedals are the same. Even minute or superficial components have tolerances that can snowball into a very different sounding result.</li>
      <li>Mark's sounded better than mine. Can't explain why or duplicate it.</li>
      <li>His choice of side jacks made for a much easier build. (I still hate side jacks, though)</li>
      <li>  More, happened to be better in this case. So they're biased a little on the hot side. Some like that way.</li>
      <li>I experimented with having a low resistor value for the LED on Mark's, and it was almost blinding, but bad-ass!</li>
    </ul>
