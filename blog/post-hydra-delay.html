  <h1><b>Hydra Delay</b></h1>
  <h5>Multi-Headed Delay Machine</h5>
  
  
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  
  <p>After building my first kit pedal - The AION FX Refractor, I got the itch to build another pedal. Something harder, and to actually try sourcing all of the parts myself, so I could inject some more creativity into it. I had my eye on the PedalPCB "Hyrda" for some time. I needed a delay on my board that wasn't part of a multi-effect. Because apparently I like doing things the hard way.</p>

  <p>I had been watching a lot of Agents of Shield and thought the evil organization of Hydra was really cool with the tentacles and so forth, so I had mocked up a design and patiently waited for the elusive SPIN FV-1 to arrive in stock.</p>
  
  <p>When COVID hit in 2020 - I got tired of waiting and went digging on Ali Express to source this elusive DSP chip.</p>

  <div class="w3-center"><img class="w3-image w3-round-large" style="max-width:25%" src="http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0135/0153/0212/products/Spin-FV-1.jpg?v=1628640228"/></div>

  <p>Once I had the parts ordered I was left looking for ways to get the artwork implemented which inspired the whole build to begin with. I didn't know of any silk screening vendors in the Conejo area, or any that would even be open to doing a one-off like this.</p>
  
  <p>Enter Mike from [vendor name], who graciously was open to listening to me about the project and was willing to take the time to talk me though some options. We weren't confident that we could etch the glossy enclosure down to the metal and I really wanted a splash of color. After all... It's a delay - it's gotta be green! So we decided to reverse etch the black backing off of a piece of vinyl, that was also cut by the laser. So it's a cover plate. It came out pretty great and then I thought; to really set this thing off, it should have UV reactive paint that makes it glow under blacklight (assuming I ever get out to a venue that has those again). I used some UV Reactive Green body paint to back fill the areas that were etched off.</p>

  <p>I then got to work stuffing the board. I hadn't done SMD soldering before and that's the only configuration the SPIN FV-1 comes as. Following some Youtube tutorials, I managed to get it onto the board.</p>

  <h3>Trouble Shooting</h3>
  
  <p>I also blew up the voltage regulator by mixing up the polarity - a learning experience! Got another and fired it back up.</p>
  
  <p>Nothing... ...?</p>
  
  <p>The LED burned out almost immediately, but I actually had audio passing and changing! Yay?! This thing was already living up to it's name having to trouble shoot one thing, only for another to spring up in it's place.</p>
  
  <p>Spent some time with the multimeter, the schematic, and after banging my head against the desk I changed the resistor value to the LED and it was now stable.</p>

  <p>I marked the enclosure and drilled it and found it matched the faceplate, which just needed some sanding down to get the fit just right.</p>

  <h3>Parts Used:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Enclosure: 125B Black Glossy from Tayda</li>
      <li>PCB: PedalPCB Hydra</li>
      <li>Knobs: black knobs from Amazon (I think)</li>
      <li>Switches: toggles from Tayda (they're actually wrong, ON-OFF-ON instead of ON-OFF) so it just has two OFF positions.</li>
      <li>Faceplate: Reverse Laser etched black with Green UV body paint</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>It sounds awesome and the analog mix using the TL072 op amp actually gives it some nice headroom and a little volume boost when engaged. The 4 heads determine the number of echoes in roughly 1/16th, 1/8ths, 1/4ths, and half-notes. The "Age" knob provides some great sounding warble which is fun to play with.</li>
      <li>The faceplate was a viable solution, but didn't come out quite as nice as I would've liked.</li>
      <li>SMD is a pain for my large hands</li>
      <li>Don't assume all values on the parts list are correct</li>
      <li>Triple check polarity on DC</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>If I were to build it again</h3>
    <p>I'd want to update the style to the matte black and throw some green knobs on it instead to have a more uniform look with my latest pedals like the Moon Chorus, and change the artwork to something more original but keep the name.</p>

  <h3>The sounds</h3>
  <p>This thing sounds absolutely wicked. The AGE knob adds some great modulation to the delayed signal. I do kind of wish it had a Tap Tempo capabilitiy.</p>
