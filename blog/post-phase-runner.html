  <h5>Multi-Stage Phaser</h5>

  <h1>Overview</h1>
    
  <p>This was probably my quickest build yet, which is based an MXR Phase 90. It aims to clone both the block and script models and has a toggle for the number of stages, which provides some interesting variations of phaser effects.</p>

  <p>Drawn on iPad Pro using Pro Create app. Since I was working from a photo of the toy model, I was able to fill only the specular highlights. There were lots of cool little details that didn't quite make their way into the laser etching. The Light Burn software does seem to have a much better tracing algorithm than Adobe Illustrator though. I know how vector graphics come out in the laser etching, but I wasn't going to use the image mode and risk having a cross-hatched or pixelated look to it.</p>
