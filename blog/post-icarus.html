    <h5>"You make guitar pedals right?"</h5>
  </div>

  <div class="w3-container">
    <h3>Backstory</h3>
    <p>I often walk my dog to a<a href="https://eurekabrewco.com/">&nbsp;local brewery tap room</a> because he&apos;s a high energy breed and I could use a visit with my pal Colin Brown who manages it. He and I like to talk music, touring stories and the gear that we like to make music with or pine about what we&apos;d like to have at our disposal.</p>
    <p>&quot;You make guitar pedals right?&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;I&nbsp;do!&quot;, I quickly replied.</p>
    <p>After a conversation he inquired if I could build him a pedal to use with a synthesizer, to match his Prophet that he intended to order. He had never owned a guitar pedal before for the purposes of using with a synth and was looking for something unique. I was happy to oblige him and we settled terms for me to build it.</p>
    <p>I&apos;ve seen a TON of EQD Acapulco Golds on boards at reddit.com/r/pedalboards and always wanted to build one. I tried one once and thought &quot;wow, that&apos;s just LOUD&quot;, but I couldn&apos;t quite grasp what it&apos;d be good for. However, I thought this sort of distortion and saturation would be useful for sound design and synths in general. I myself, am a fan of the sausage fattener plug-in for that sort of thing.</p>
    <p>A stereo version would&apos;ve been ideal (for a synth player), but perhaps a bit ambitious. Certainly do-able, using some dual gang pots, as long as I can order some pre-built PCBs... but after a quick check from my usual sources; they were all SOLD OUT. Lame. This would probably have to wait awhile unless... aha!</p>
    <p>I set down my &quot;Just a Phaze IPA&quot; (Fantastic BTW) and dug into the schematics for the pedal I intended to build and discovered it to be relatively simple; something I could sink my teeth into, and learn how to make my OWN circuit board. I hadn&apos;t done this before and it would&apos;ve helped me immensely with some of my other ambitious projects, so I conceded with my inner self that&nbsp;now&nbsp;was the time to learn this.</p>
    <p>&quot;Doesn&apos;t look that complicated to me...&quot;</p>
    <p>I reached out to a colleague, Ryan Feves (Sound Designer at Yamaha Guitar Group / Line 6 / Ampeg) about which software and prototype suppliers he liked to use and he gave me some excellent recommendations about<a href="https://www.kicad.org/">&nbsp;KiCad</a> and<a href="https://jlcpcb.com/">&nbsp;JLCPCB</a>. KiCad being open source and better yet, free, was a great motivator. I decided to give it a go.</p>
    <p>Yeah, this is based of the Muzikding Acapulco - but I wanted to&nbsp;add&nbsp;some <i>stuff</i>.</p>
    <p>But first, I needed to rough out the layout and consider the aesthetics, because I am all about&nbsp;that.</p>
    <p>Yeah, more video game stuff. Or at least, that is how it began. I quickly realized that I needed to move on from adjacent intellectual property when I intend to make something I wish to sell, no matter how tongue-in-cheek the reference may be. So I re-designed it.</p>
    <p>I looked up a couple mods that seemed to be popular on Reddit and considered a couple things.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
          <p>This thing is ridiculously loud... it&apos;s two power amps chained together. So an INPUT volume would be helpful. Easy 1M pot for the input!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>Changing coupling cap values are a&nbsp;thing?&nbsp;Changing the values for those can produce different tones or noise floors? Yeah, that&apos;s going IN! (Initially, I wanted this to be a bass boost, but upon further examination of the data sheet, there&apos;s better ways to accomplish this). I went for 2n2 vs. the standard 4n7 as an option.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>200x Gain per stage is a LOT. So let&apos;s make a choice to lower the first one to just 20x (or 50x?). no spoilers.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>I set out in KiCad with my ambitions to make a cooler, more usable Acapulco Gold, as if I could do better than the excellent and prolific Earth Quaker Devices.</p>
    <p>No too shabby, in my opinion. Thanks to Ryan Feves for the pointers on layout and trace width. I still owe you a beer my friend! Neat, I love 3D stuff. Honestly, this is SO helpful to ensure the footprints are correct.</p>
    <p>JLCPCB even included some hard candy and a sticker. How cute!</p>
    <p>To my whole surprise, the PCBs came in just after my vacation and I got to admire them.</p>
    <h3>BUT DOES IT WORK?</h3>
    <p>Only one way to find out.</p>
    <p>[&nbsp;I need to figure out how to embed a video here in a reasonable manner - IMG 7054&nbsp;]</p>
    <p>It totally <i>does!</i> Even the mods worked as I intended... mostly! The coupling cap mod was way more subtle that I thought it would be, but the zero ohm resistor that Ryan suggested was very useful for cutting the first gain stage down from 200x or 0x, to 200x vs. 50x. Just required a little off-board wires to accomplish yet another mod.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Overall, I am extremely happy with this build. It sounds great, and looks good too. This will be a memorable one for me because it&apos;s the first guitar pedal I&apos;ve built that has my own circuit board in it! The first enclosure didn&apos;t come out as well as the second (to fix alignment issues) but I took the time to etch the serial numbers on them.</p>
    <h3>RetrospectiVE</h3>
    <p>If I could, I would&apos;ve taken the time to explore really doing a stereo version with dual-ganged pots so it could be a great synth box. I&apos;d also take some time to take a simple circuit such as this to verify the &quot;mods&quot; I tried, rather than rely on the other DIY builders on Reddit, as awesome as they are.</p>
    <h3>WANT ONE? YOU CAN GET ONE!</h3>
    <p>Yeah, that&apos;s right, I&apos;ve got parts for 3 more of these bad boys so see your way to the Reverb store for a chance to snag yours today!</p>
